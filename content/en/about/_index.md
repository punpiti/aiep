We didn't start with a curriculum.  
We started with a question:  
**Can Thailand build truly new technology?**

## 🌱 The Origin

Imagine building an autonomous vehicle in Thailand.

- Computer engineers know nothing about dynamics or mechanical integration.
- Mechanical engineers don’t have the deep AI skills to design the intelligence.

Opening a brand-new program in “Autonomous Systems” sounds futuristic — but also fragile. Too specific. Too easy to be disrupted.

And what if…

- The computer engineers are too busy and not interested in new, uncertain fields?
- The mechanical engineers take a two-year master’s in computer science and never return to their original domain?

So we asked:
> **What if mechanical engineers could master AI… faster?**  
> **What if they didn’t have to leave their discipline to lead it into the future?**

That was the start of the AI-Integrated Engineering Program.

We began by embedding AI into the *existing* curriculum of mechanical engineering — not replacing it. Students would gain AI skills quickly, deeply, and practically — finishing their master’s within just one year after the bachelor’s.

A win for students, for faculty, and for the nation.

## 🧠 Program Design

The initiative was led by the **Department of Computer Engineering**, driven by the belief that AI will soon be essential to every profession.

Early steps included:

- Offering **AI-Empowered Digital Life** as a new general education course  
- Creating **Applied AI for Engineering** as an elective across all engineering disciplines

But it wasn’t enough. We realized the integration had to go deeper.  
So the Faculty of Engineering committed to **a full transformation** — one that combines domain expertise with AI fluency.

That became the core of AIEP:  
**Deep Engineering. Advanced AI. In One Program.**

## 🌏 Long-Term Vision

We don’t plan to stop at engineering.

Our long-term goal is to bring **AI x [Every Discipline]** to life at Kasetsart University —  
from agriculture and economics to veterinary medicine and beyond.

The future of Thai innovation depends on **collaboration** — not silos.

**AIEP is just the beginning.**
