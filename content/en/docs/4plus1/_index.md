## 🎓 What is the 4+1 Program?

The **4+1 Pathway** is a fast-track academic structure that allows qualified undergraduate students to continue seamlessly into the **Master of Engineering in AI-Integrated Engineering**, completing both degrees within five years.

- 🧑‍🎓 **4 years** in your home department (e.g., Mechanical, Civil, Environmental, etc.)  
- ➕ **1 extra year** to complete the AI-Integrated Master’s degree  
- 🎯 Integrated coursework, capstone, and research planning  
- ✅ Saves time and tuition while preparing you for AI-driven innovation

---

## 🧠 Why Choose the 4+1 Program?

This pathway ensures that:

- 🏗️ **You maintain full professional depth** in your core engineering field  
    - You will graduate from your home department (e.g., Civil, Chemical, Mechanical) as a full-fledged engineer.
- 🤖 **You gain real, hands-on AI expertise**  
    - Not just using tools — you will **build models, write code, and solve real problems** under guidance from AI experts in Computer Engineering.
- 🚀 **You upgrade your profile** to match the demands of the modern engineering workforce  
    - AI-literate engineers are in high demand across all fields — from energy and manufacturing to infrastructure and smart cities.
- 📚 **You enjoy interdisciplinary learning**  
    - Study and collaborate across departments with peers from different AI+X Engineering tracks.
