**AI-Integrated Electrical Engineering: Smarter Systems, Stronger Engineers**  

> Not every electrical engineering student wants to become a data scientist.  

But if you're building systems ‚Äî power grids, communication networks, signal filters, or electronic circuits ‚Äî it's time to equip yourself with the tools that will shape the next era.

This track is designed for students in **power systems, electronics, signal processing, and communication engineering** who want to make their expertise more intelligent and future-proof.

You‚Äôll learn how **AI can optimize and extend what you already understand**:

- Predicting power demand and preventing failures in smart grids  
- Diagnosing electronic system health before it breaks down  
- Extracting meaningful patterns from noisy signals  
- Enhancing wireless communication efficiency using AI-based models

> No need to be an AI expert from day one.  
> You bring the **engineering mindset** ‚Äî and we‚Äôll bring the AI tools to amplify your impact.

**Graduates will be future-ready engineers** who understand both the physics of real-world systems and how to use AI to make them more robust, efficient, and adaptive.
