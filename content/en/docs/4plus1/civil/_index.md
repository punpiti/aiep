## 🔍 What is AI x Civil Engineering?

Modern civil engineers must design for complexity, uncertainty, and urban dynamics. This program equips students to:

- Apply AI to **Building Information Modeling (BIM)** for clash detection, Scan-to-BIM, and automated BOQ analysis
- Monitor and analyze infrastructure with **Structural Health Monitoring (SHM)** and digital twins
- Leverage **GeoAI** to map terrain, analyze flood risk, and design infrastructure using satellite/LiDAR data
- Model floods, traffic, and urban environments with AI-based simulations
- Use AI for **Construction Management**, including delay prediction, drone image analysis, and generative planning
- Advance **Construction Material Science** with sustainable, AI-designed mixtures
- Design **Human-Centered Infrastructure** by analyzing mobility and behavioral data from sensors and mobile devices
