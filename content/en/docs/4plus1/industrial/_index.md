> **AI-Integrated Industrial Engineering** redefines the role of IE professionals in an age where algorithms can automate decisions, optimize systems, and manage workflows.  
> Instead of simply improving existing processes, graduates of this program are trained to co-design future-ready operations — using AI, data, and digital twins as their toolbox.

> With strong foundations in operations research, supply chain, manufacturing systems, and human factors — enhanced with machine learning, simulation, and intelligent automation — students will lead the transformation of factories, warehouses, and digital operations.

> Whether the task is real-time scheduling of production lines, predictive analytics for inventory, or developing human-in-the-loop decision systems, AI will no longer be optional — it will be your core toolkit.
