## Master of Engineering in AI-Integrated Engineering

The **Master of Engineering in AI-Integrated Engineering** is a graduate program designed to empower professionals with both domain-specific engineering expertise and applied artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.

This program is open to graduates from **all disciplines**, not just computer science or engineering. It is structured to be **completed within 2 years** and is especially ideal for students coming from the **4+1 academic track** at Kasetsart University. These students benefit from prior exposure to AI foundations and research integration during their undergraduate senior project, allowing them to fast-track through the program without repeating fundamental training.

### Key Features

- 🔬 **AI-Driven Specialization**: Students apply AI techniques (e.g., machine learning, data science, computer vision) to real-world problems within their domain.
- 🧠 **Deep + Applied Learning**: While the focus is application-oriented, students will gain **deep conceptual understanding** and learn to integrate AI with prior engineering knowledge.
- ⚙️ **For Everyone, Optimized for 4+1**: Students from any background can succeed, but those from the 4+1 track will skip foundational AI/practical programming preparation and directly pursue advanced integration and research.

### Graduation Requirements

To complete the degree, students must:

- 🧪 Conduct a research project relevant to AI in engineering
- 📄 Publish at least one peer-reviewed article or conference paper
- 🎓 Demonstrate the ability to integrate AI with domain knowledge through a thesis or capstone project

### Career Opportunities

Graduates will be equipped to:

- Work as **Data Analysts**, **AI Engineers**, or **Smart System Developers**
- Return to their **original careers**, now empowered with AI thinking and tools
- Contribute to **interdisciplinary innovation teams** in both industry and academia

### Curriculum Overview

- **Core AI Modules**: Machine Learning, Optimization, AI Systems, and Data Engineering
- **Applied Engineering AI**: Tailored projects and elective tracks based on student background
- **Integration Labs**: Hands-on development and deployment using real data
- **Seminar + Research**: Writing, publication, and presentation training
