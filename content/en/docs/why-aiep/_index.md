## 💡 What Makes AIEP Unique?

- 🧠 **AI + Engineering, Not Just Coding**  
  Students don’t just “learn Python” — they solve real problems in energy, materials, manufacturing, environment, and infrastructure with machine learning and modern data tools.

- 🎓 **4+1 Structure = Two Degrees in 5 Years**  
  Earn a Bachelor’s in your core engineering field AND a Master’s in AI-Integrated Engineering — saving time, boosting depth, and preparing for interdisciplinary leadership.

- 🧪 **Capstone with Real Industry Data**  
  Final-year projects come from actual challenges in leading companies, guided by faculty and industry mentors.

- 🌐 **Shared Learning with Other Disciplines**  
  Be part of a multi-disciplinary community: civil + computer + chemical + environmental — all solving problems together with AI.

- ✈️ **Global-Minded, Future-Proofed**  
  Designed for a global workforce: English-medium courses, international collaborations, and exposure to tools used worldwide.

## 🙋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Do I need to be good at coding?**  
A: No. We teach coding from zero. What's more important is your mindset: curiosity, logical thinking, and willingness to learn.

**Q: Will I get two degrees?**  
A: Yes — one B.Eng. in your core field and one M.Eng. in AI-Integrated Engineering (if you pass the GPA and performance requirements).

**Q: What if I just want to finish the Bachelor’s degree?**  
A: That’s totally fine. The 4+1 model is flexible — you can complete your Bachelor’s degree with all the benefits of AIEP experience, and decide later whether to continue.
